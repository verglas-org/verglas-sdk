# Verglas JavaScript Cloudflare Workers

This package builds an ordinary Cloudflare-style Worker project into a
WebAssembly component. Tenant code imports `DurableObject` from
`cloudflare:workers`; it does not import a Verglas shim.

## Build a project

The supported `wrangler.jsonc` subset is:

```jsonc
{
	"name": "counter",
	"main": "worker.js",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-01-01",
	"compatibility_flags": [],
	"durable_objects": {
		"bindings": [{ "name": "COUNTER", "class_name": "Counter" }],
	},
	"migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["Counter"] }],
	"vars": { "GREETING": "hello" },
}
```

Unknown keys are errors. Migration entries accept `tag`, `new_classes`, and
`new_sqlite_classes`; other migration kinds are errors. The build command is:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @verglas-org/worker-js
npx verglas-worker-build ./my-worker --out ./build [--gateway <gateway.json>]
```

The builder bundles the project, aliases the `cloudflare:workers` module, and
componentizes it against the `service` WIT world. It writes a digest-named
`<sha256>.wasm` artifact and a Wrangler-shaped `manifest.out.json` whose
`artifacts.worker` descriptor (and `artifacts.durable_object` when Durable
Objects are declared) names the exact digest and output directory. If the
selected gateway manifest exists, it must already use those nested descriptors;
the builder updates them and preserves a final newline. Retired top-level
`component_digest` and `component_dir` fields are rejected.

## Cloudflare authoring surface

A project uses the documented Cloudflare shape:

```js
import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";

export class Counter extends DurableObject {
	async fetch(request) {
		const row = this.ctx.storage.sql.exec("SELECT count FROM counter").one();
		return Response.json(row);
	}
}

export default {
	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
		const id = env.COUNTER.idFromName("global");
		return env.COUNTER.get(id).fetch(request);
	},
};
```

`env` contains `vars` and Durable Object namespace bindings. A namespace
implements `idFromName`, `idFromString`, `newUniqueId`, and `get`. Named IDs
are lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 digests of their names. A stub's `fetch`
method is routed through the WIT `bindings.do-fetch` host capability.

`ctx.waitUntil(promise)` is awaited before a Worker event completes. This is a
known v0 divergence from Cloudflare's ability to continue work after sending a
response. `passThroughOnException` is accepted by the context but has no
pass-through host route.

### Scheduled Workers and historical catch-up

The manifest accepts ordinary cron strings and Verglas schedule objects:

```jsonc
"triggers": {
  "crons": [{
    "cron": "0 0 * * *",
    "start_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "max_concurrent": 4
  }]
}
```

`start_date` is an inclusive UTC lower bound for historical cron instances;
`max_concurrent` must be between 1 and 32. The live and catch-up cursors advance
independently, with live work receiving the first concurrency slot. A
`scheduled(controller, env, ctx)` handler must use `controller.scheduledTime`
as its logical job time: it is historical during catch-up and current during a
normal cron run.

### Pipeline Stream bindings

The manifest accepts the exact Cloudflare-shaped binding form:

```jsonc
"pipelines": [
  { "binding": "STREAM", "stream": "stream-id" }
]
```

Unknown keys are hard errors. `env.STREAM` is a dedicated binding with
`send(records, { eventIds })`. It requires an array whose values are
JSON-serializable,
encodes the array as compact UTF-8 JSON, and rejects encoded requests above
5 MiB before calling `verglas:do-worker/bindings@0.1.0` `do-fetch`. The call is
`(binding, stream, { method: "POST", uri: "https://verglas.internal/stream/append",
headers: [["content-type", "application/json"]], body, ws: undefined })`.
Only a 2xx response resolves the Promise; host errors and every other status
reject, with no fallback path. Structured Stream schema validation is not part
of this SDK surface yet; Pipeline processing must perform that validation.
When supplied, `eventIds` must contain exactly one 1–512 character stable ID per
record. Verglas forwards the IDs in `x-verglas-producer-event-id`, allowing a
retried Worker or notebook cell to append idempotently.

## Durable Object storage and events

`DurableObject` receives the Cloudflare `ctx` and `env` constructor arguments.
`ctx.storage.get`, `put`, `delete`, and `list` send structured-clone bytes over
the WIT storage verbs. The guest does not create a KV table and does not submit
canonical transaction envelopes; the sandboxed host owns event transactions,
commit ordering, and durability. Missing storage capabilities fail clearly.

`ctx.storage.sql.exec(query, ...bindings)` sends one SQL statement to
`storage.sql-rows`. The returned cursor has `toArray()`, `one()`, `raw()`,
`columnNames`, `rowsRead`, and `rowsWritten`. Positional bindings are rendered
as SQL literals before crossing WIT because the v2 SQL verb carries one
statement string. SQL rows are JSON objects supplied by the host.

`ctx.storage.setAlarm`, `getAlarm`, and `deleteAlarm` call the alarm WIT verbs.
The handler export maps `alarm()` to the user's Durable Object alarm method.

The guest uses StarlingMonkey's real WHATWG `Request`, `Response`, `Headers`,
`WebSocketPair`, and WebSocket globals. Only request and response records with
byte bodies and ordered header tuples cross WIT. A pending upgrade request is
accepted by `ctx.acceptWebSocket(server)` and a `Response` with status 101 and
the client WebSocket; the handler response carries the accepted WIT socket ID.
Socket messages and closes are delivered as Durable Object methods.

## Component imports and audit

The component imports only:

- `verglas:do-worker/storage@0.1.0`
- `verglas:do-worker/sockets@0.1.0`
- `verglas:do-worker/bindings@0.1.0`

It exports the Worker `fetch` interface and the Durable Object `handler`
interface. ComponentizeJS is invoked with `--disable=all`; the build requests no
WASI imports. The storage adapter is a sandboxed guest adapter and crosses only
the declared WIT imports.

## Local checks

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --dir packages/worker-js test
npx verglas-worker-build examples/do-workers/js-counter --out /tmp/js-build
```

The tests cover the SHA-256 namespace IDs, structured-clone storage, SQL
cursors, alarms, concurrency and waitUntil, HTTP boundary conversions, strict
Wrangler manifest parsing, digest/gateway synchronization, component WIT
conformance, and the no-WASI import audit.
